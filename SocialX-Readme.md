## SocialX


SocialX is a test app used to test google, facebook and email-password sign in through firebase.


### Dependencies used


* Retrofit 
* Facebook SDK
* Firebase auth
* Firebase Firestore
* Livedata
* Coroutines


### Notes
Used MVVM architecture for the development of the app.
Due to the limited time constraint I was only able to create the login and registration for a specific user through facebook, google, email and password with firebase.
The network call to news api was not completed because of the limited time of one day.
Was planning to use Hilt for dependency injection but as there was no time left it was not achieved.
